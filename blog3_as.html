<h3>Why Open Source?</h3>

	In 1970, Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson created Unix at Bell Labs, MIT.
But it was proprietary, where the copyright of source code isn’t given away.Frustrated by not being able to edit the source code, Richard Stallman founded the GNU project in 1983, introducing the concept of free software. 
Free Software gave its users the freedom to  run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. <br>
By the way, GNU stands for ‘GNU’s Not Unix’. <br>
While other programs for making the GNU OS had been written down, the Kernel was still left. While 21, Linus Torvalds was working on his own OS kernel, which eventually became the Linux kernel and was integrated with GNU components to make a fully functional and free OS.Organisations like NASA, Dell, IBM started taking advantage of its flexibility and tweaked Linux to their needs. This allowed them to make complex products quickly. 
While companies benefited a lot from Linux, majority were still in the dark, until Google released Android.
<b>2.5 Billion</b> devices run the Linux based OS right now.
Modern Softwares are too huge to be developed from scratch. Modern Automobiles have more lines of codes than earlier Spacecrafts.  <br> Summing up, Open Source is only going to grow as complexity of problems around us increase. Solving world’s biggest problems needs collaborating efforts, while it being an effective business model as well. Let’s see where it goes!
