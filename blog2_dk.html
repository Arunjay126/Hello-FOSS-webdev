<h3>Format and Steps to add a blog</h3>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li> Refer <a href="{{ "/blog1_dk.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" >Blog #1</a> to start this website on your localhost and make changes. Open this folder in any text editor </li>
		<li> Create a <code>blog#n.html</code> file in this folder. Copy the content from thr <code>trial.html</code> file into this new file you created. Now with the knowledge of basic HTML you can add the content you wish to.</li>
		<li>Now, open the <code>blogs.html</code> file and copy the commented part in the same file and uncomment one of them. Do not uncomment without copying, creating this extra copy will help the next person from you. </li>
		<li> After making the dits as suggested there and chnaging generic content by your dynamic names, we're good to go</li>
		<li> Before merging your file check once if the edits are made properly. Refresh the page on your localhost and you should be able to see your blog's preview in the list of community blogs and the read more should direct to the complete blog. If this test goes well, hurry up and add a PR!</li>
	</ol>
The main purpose of Open Source is to grow by learning from others' experiences and mistakes rather than starting from scratch. Use this "Community Blog" to learn from others and also help others grow :)<br/>
PS: Best suggestion for one's first blog is the errors he/she faced while installing Jekyll, cause most of us face similar installation issues. </p>
