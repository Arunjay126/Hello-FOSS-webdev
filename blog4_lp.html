		<h4> #1: Choose the project</h4> 
		<p>Check the projects under Hello FOSS <b><a href="https://github.com/wncc/CodeInQuarantine/tree/master/Week_4_Git">repository</a></b> and the instructions given in the repository of your choice.
		</p>
		<h4> #2: Fork the repository </h4> 
		<p>Fork the repository of your choice by clicking on the fork button on the top of the github page of the respective repository. This step will create a copy of the repo in your account.
		</p>
		<h4> #3: Clone the repository</h4> 
		<p>Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the <b>Code</b> button and then click the copy to clipboard icon.
		</p>
		<p>
		Open a terminal and run the following git command:
		<code>git clone "url"</code>
		where "url" is the url you copied.

		<br>
		For example:
		<code>git clone https://github.com/username/Hello-FOSS.git</code>
		where username is your GitHub username. The contents of your copy of the project are now copied to your machine.
		</p>

		<h4> #4: Create a branch</h4> 
		<p>Change to the repository directory on your machine: <code> cd Hello-FOSS</code>
		<br>
		Create a branch using the command: <code> git checkout -b new-branch-name </code>
		</p>

		<h4> #5: Make necessary changes and Commit</h4> 
		<p> Now complete the task in this branch. Make all necessary changes here. Now commit these changes using the following commands.
				<br>
				<code> git add . </code> 
				<br>
				<code> git commit -m "Commit message" </code>
			

		<h4> #6: Push changes to Github </h4> 
		<p> Push your changes using the command : <code>git push origin new-branch-name </code>
		This step will save all your local changes to your forked repository on GitHub in a branch "new-branch-name".

		<h4> #7: Hit Us a pull request</h4> 
		<p> Go to your repository on GitHub and you will see a Compare and Pull Request button. Click on that and then submit the pull request. Ensure that you follow this <b><a href="https://github.com/wncc/Hello-FOSS/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md"> template</a></b> while sending your Pull Request.
